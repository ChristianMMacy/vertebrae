A Backbone pattern that focuses on composability and modular design.

## Start
I came up with this pattern from a few different sources as I was working on a Backbone project for a client. The idea is to focus on composability and make it super easy to create modules that can be dropped in to extend your project.

While I recognize that there are lots of ways to go about achieving similar results, I liked the idea of putting this out there to get feedback and ideas. So think of this as a project to play with, break, and give feedback on. If you love it and want to use this pattern in your own project please make sure to contribute your experiences as issues or PRs!

## Play
The sample project included is pretty convoluted but I wanted to be able to demonstrate how to do what I'm describing pretty quickly and easily.

``npm -i`` and go from there. I'll post more info and instructions as this get fleshed out.
